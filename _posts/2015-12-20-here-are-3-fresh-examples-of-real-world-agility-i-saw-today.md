When I talk about agility I have no idea what I actually mean.

Here are 3 fresh examples of real world Agility I saw today.

## John the agile musician.

John and I do gigs. A classical violin duo. Weddings, corporate events, parties. We rest our music on wire stands. Today it was windy.

5 minutes before the bride was scheduled to arrive John spotted a clothes line.

He borrowed some pegs to hold our music so it wouldn't blow away.

## Jenny the agile swimmer

Jenny swam 6km after work.

To prevent fog she tried licking the inside of her goggles.

The saliva kept the moister from sticking to the plastic.

## Alex the agile barista

I ordered a latte.

Alex ran out of brown sugar.

He used honey.
