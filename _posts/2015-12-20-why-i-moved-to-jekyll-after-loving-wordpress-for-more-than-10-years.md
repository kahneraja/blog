I've been writing on wordpress now for over 10 years and I've finally decided to get cool and move to jekyll. Here's why.

## Page load time.

Precompilation means the page lots a lot faster.

## I'm a Developer. I like flexibility. I like Markdown.

The experience of publishing with wordpress is more suitable for journalists, content writers, basically anyone who doesn't enjoy code.

I like code. I think in Markdown. Working with Jekyll allows me to be a little more creative.

## I really like Git and free stuff.

Git helps me publish and track versioning. It's also free.

AWS running my site on an EC2 server was costing me approx $40/month.

## No computation, No Database.

Mysql and PHP just freaks me out.

> "Server side rendering has basically been pushed out of the way."

With a whole new world of distributed web technologies it's now quite a straight forward exercise to handle things like "membership", "ecommerce", "document store", and "data" via javascript connected services like UserApp, Firebase, Snicart, SendOwl and other things.

## How long did it take?

1. Sat through a 3hr pluralsight course.
2. 

## Pain points?

I really like the wordpress mobile app. I use it to edit stuff and it's support sweet. I will miss that.
